1. Compile and build
====================

To compile and build ANNOTATE use:

   make


2. Install
==========

To install ANNOTATE use:

   make install

To install under a specific PREFIX use:

   make install PREFIX=/usr/local

For packaging use DESTDIR:

   make install PREFIX=/usr/local DESTDIR=/tmp/destdir

This will install ANNOTATE_v<VERSION> in PREFIX/bin


3. Running ANNOTATE
===================

You can run ANNOTATE directly from the build directory with:

./ANNOTATE

or to get more help:

./ANNOTATE -h

After installation you can also run it with:

ANNOTATE_v<VERSION> (e.g. ANNOTATE_v3.05)

Make sure the installation prefixes bindir is in your PATH:

e.g. (in bash)

  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}
