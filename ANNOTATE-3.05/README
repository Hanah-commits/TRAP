TRAP/Annotation Tool

README By Morgane Thomas_Chollier

10th July 2009
--------------

Changes made to version v2.07 => v3.01

- complete and reorganised the manual
- enhance the option validation/checking
- hit_based: modified the cutoff option.
	option -t is the external cutoff given by the user (no change here)
	
	if the cutoff is included in the header of the matrix:
	either /cutoff= 
	or 3 types of headers:
	/type_I_cutoff='7.35' /type_II_cutoff='3.5' /balanced_cutoff='5.65'
	new option --ttype allows to choose between these 3 values : typeI, type II, balanced
 
 - extract matrix conversion formats from the annotation tool:
 	1 program: 	convert-pscm
 				convert pscm to pssm or psem, with input format in transfac or bulyck format
 				where the pseudocounts, gc contents ... are dealt with
 	1 program: 	TRAP
 				handles the calculation of the hits or the affinity
 	1 wrapper in PERL, called Annotation, that calls the two programs
 	
 - convert-pscm:
 => manual
 => explicit options for range of GC content, G+C content more modular
 => matrix header tokenizer function enhanced : take all informations (not just name and cutoff), allow : or =, with '' or not
 => separate a "write matrix" class, for clarity
 => simplify handling of the reverse matrix
 => ouput pssm, psem + pspm
 
- ANNOTATE

=> enhance the window system for small shift (large overlapping regions)
=> enhance masking system. Possibility to score N instead of skipping the entire match (--mscore option)

Summary of new options

--range
--mscore

17th December 2009
--------------

Changes made to version v3.01 => v3.02

-Added the option --discard, which allows to discard some positions of the motif. The program assigns the highest mismatch value to this (these) position(s).

19th April 2010
--------------

Changes made to version v3.01 => v3.02b

Debug the --ttype option

28th June 2010
--------------

Changes made to version v3.02b => v3.03

- Documentation: add -name 
- added the --tab option to output a table instead of a GFF file (only compatible with affinity calculation, for use with PASTAA)

6th January 2011
--------------

Changes made to version v3.03 => v3.04
- strand option to allow single strand calculation
- fix bug: the program does not loop forever if the input sequence file is not a fasta file. Now produce an error.

14th June 2013
--------------

Changes made to version v3.04 => v3.04.01
by  Marius Tolzmann <marius.tolzmann@molgen.mpg.de>

- fix build bug ("g++ -arch" is not known on linux and was introduced in 3.04)

Changes made to version v3.04.01 => v3.05
by  Marius Tolzmann <marius.tolzmann@molgen.mpg.de>

- change the build system by rewriting the makefile
- Add new install target to make file
- Now "make && make install" works out of the box and accepts
  PREFIX and DESTDIR


____________________________________________________________________________
IDEAS:
- handling of ambiguous nucleotides
- masking upper/lower case
- triming the matrix columns that are poorly informative, around the core of the matrix (Helge's way)
- type option (as Helge), which is a correction for the varying lengths of the promoters
